# Burp-Shortime-Refresh-Token-Handler
A simple Jython script for Burp Suite to handle short time refresh tokens

Just edit the top part of the script to put the URL to retrieve the token and load it in burp

This extension will act as a TokenJar and add a session Handler for the extension to request a new token if needed
